== Description ==

Easy English WP (Lite) lets you add Easy English / Easy Read content to posts and pages as simple rows (image + short text), with a front-end toggle so visitors can switch between normal and Easy English views. It’s designed for cognitive accessibility and works alongside your existing accessibility tools without touching your builder markup.

Who it’s for: health, disability, community, government, education, and any team that wants clearer, easier-to-read pages.

Key points:
* Focused on cognitive accessibility: provide simplified text and visuals to complement (not replace) technical accessibility plugins.
* Safe with page builders: wraps your content without altering builder shortcodes or markup.
* Free/Lite version: limited to 5 published posts/pages with Easy English enabled.

== Features ==

* Create Easy English rows (image + text) for posts and pages.
* Floating toolbar to switch between normal and Easy English content on the front end.
* Works with Classic editor and Gutenberg (block editor).
* Designed to play nicely with major page builders (Elementor, Divi, Beaver Builder, WPBakery, etc.) by not modifying their internal markup.
* Free/Lite limit: enable Easy English on up to 5 published posts/pages.
* Pro (not in this plugin yet) will add AI-assisted helpers and advanced tools.
